# How Have Math Scores Evolved Over Time for Boston Public School Students?

This was a semester-long consultancy project for [Bridge To Calculus](https://bridgetocalculus.sites.northeastern.edu/), a non-profit organization that offers calculus tutoring out of Northeastern to help improve the math performance for Boston Public Schools.

### Our Work

Bridge To Calculus wanted to visualize the data related to math performance, particularly for the 2 key standardized tests (MCAS and NAEP). We delved deep into this data and produced an interactive website to accomplish this.
